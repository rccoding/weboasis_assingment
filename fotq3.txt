				     				FUTURE OF TECHNOLOGY

Today,we are living in a world where almost everyone start his/her day from checking their phone/laptop and ending 
the day by commanding "ALEXA TURN OFF THE LIGHTS",techonology is almost everywhere ,so in my vision future of tech 
is rephrasing my sentance to technology is everywhere,like switching to cryptocurrencies in our day to day transaction to depending on techonology
to do our day-to-day chores.The concepts like ML or AI will shape the future of tech like machines taking over humans for doing even the basic tasks,
making healthcare services cheaper like offerring symptom checking and fast access to physicians if needed.You must have heard the term NFT's(non fungible tokens)
they took the internet by storm by providing a platform where we can sell our digital art in exchange of cryptocurrencies and changing the way of auctioning.In future 
we will enter a virtual world where there will be no need to go out for our business meetings,shopping like meta is developing its own worls METAVERSE!
From inserting chips in human brain to robot based world, the future is promising as well scary too.							
							

							      HOW DO I ENVISION MYSELF?
As an aspiring data scientist and ai developer ,i wish to contribute in developing devicies such as a blind person can visualize the world around him/her
i envision myself working on an another technical world made by maybe another company and developing techniques,using sql or 
mongodb to store all the informaton to process by a machine which will then learn to process all those thing with the help of 
algorithms given by machine learning technique,i also have interest in block chain development so i would contribute to that as well.
